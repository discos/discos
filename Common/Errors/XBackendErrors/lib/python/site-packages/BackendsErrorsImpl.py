        An instance of this class is derived from the CORBA class of 
        similar name. The difference between the two is that this class
        provides many additional helper methods from Acspy.Common.Err.

        There are three different combinations of keyword parameter
        uses that make sense here:

            __init__()
              Using the default values creates a new exception which 
              does not include any previous error traces
            
            __init__(exception=someOldException)
              Specifying a previous ACS Error System exception or 
              without changing the value of create 
              creates a new exception which does in fact include 
              previous error traces from someOldException.

            __init__(exception=someOldException, create=0)
              Used to reconstruct someOldException without adding any
              new error trace information. It is absolutely critical
              that someOldException be of the same CORBA type as this
              class implements!

            nvSeq default keyword parameter
              This sequence of name/values is only used when a new 
              exception is being created. In simple terms, the only
              time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

            severity default keyword parameter
              This CORBA type corresponds to ACSErr.Severity. The
              only time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

        Parameters:
        - nvSeq is a sequence of ACSErr.NameValue pairs used to add
        additional information about the exception. Only used when
        create has a value of 1/True
        - exception is an ACS Error System based CORBA exception
        Provide this to extract previous error trace 
        information and put this into the new object being constructed
        - create is a boolean value which defines whether or not traceback
        information should be extracted from the call to create this exception
        and added to it's error trace. If you're simply trying to recreate
        a remote CORBA exception locally and figure out what went wrong
        most likely you want create to have a value of 0. However, if you
        intend on rethrowing the exception a value of 1 makes more sense.
        - severity is used to set the severity of exception. Only used when
        create has a value of 1/True

        Constructor
        
        An instance of this class is derived from the CORBA class of 
        similar name. The difference between the two is that this class
        provides many additional helper methods from Acspy.Common.Err.

        There are three different combinations of keyword parameter
        uses that make sense here:

            __init__()
              Using the default values creates a new exception which 
              does not include any previous error traces
            
            __init__(exception=someOldException)
              Specifying a previous ACS Error System exception or 
              without changing the value of create 
              creates a new exception which does in fact include 
              previous error traces from someOldException.

            __init__(exception=someOldException, create=0)
              Used to reconstruct someOldException without adding any
              new error trace information. It is absolutely critical
              that someOldException be of the same CORBA type as this
              class implements!

            nvSeq default keyword parameter
              This sequence of name/values is only used when a new 
              exception is being created. In simple terms, the only
              time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

            severity default keyword parameter
              This CORBA type corresponds to ACSErr.Severity. The
              only time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

        Parameters:
        - nvSeq is a sequence of ACSErr.NameValue pairs used to add
        additional information about the exception. Only used when
        create has a value of 1/True
        - exception is an ACS Error System based CORBA exception
        Provide this to extract previous error trace 
        information and put this into the new object being constructed
        - create is a boolean value which defines whether or not traceback
        information should be extracted from the call to create this exception
        and added to it's error trace. If you're simply trying to recreate
        a remote CORBA exception locally and figure out what went wrong

        Constructor
        
        An instance of this class is derived from ACSErr.Completion. 
        It provides many helper methods from Acspy.Common.Err.
        
        There are three different combinations of keyword parameter
        uses that make sense here:
            
            __init__()
              Using the default values creates a new Completion which 
              does not include any previous error traces
            
            __init__(exception=acsException)
              Specifying a previous ACS Error System exception without
              changing the value of create creates a new Completion which
              does in fact include previous error traces from
              acsException.
            
            __init__(exception=acsException, create=0)
              Used to reconstruct acsException without adding any
              new error trace information.

            nvSeq default keyword parameter
              This sequence of name/values is only used when a new 
              Completion is being created. In simple terms, the only
              time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

            severity default keyword parameter
              This CORBA type corresponds to ACSErr.Severity. The
              only time you can use it is when the create keyword parameter
              has the value of 1

        Parameters:
        - nvSeq is a sequence of ACSErr.NameValue pairs used to add
        additional information about the Completion. Only used when
        create has a value of 1
        - exception is an ACS Error System based CORBA exception. 
	Provide this to extract previous error trace information and put this into
        the new object being constructed
        - create is a boolean value which defines whether or not traceback
        information should be extracted from the call to create this Completion
        and added to it's error trace. If you're simply trying to recreate
        a remote CORBA exception locally and figure out 
        what went wrong most likely you want create to have a value of 0. 
        However, if you intend on returning the Completion a value of 1 makes
