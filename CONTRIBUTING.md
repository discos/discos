## How to suggest a feature or enhancement.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. 
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, 
why you need it, and how it should work.

## Our workflow with GitHub

Our GitHub-based [workflow](https://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/howto/github/index.html)  is very simple. The master branch is dedicated to implement new features and capabilities.
The stable branch will be used for software releses according our [policy](https://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/releasing.html)
