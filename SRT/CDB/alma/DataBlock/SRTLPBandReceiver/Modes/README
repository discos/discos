Each mode is composed by 4 characters, that indicate respectively the:

    - L band polarization (*, L, C)
    - L band filter ID (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    - P band polarization (*, L, C)
    - P band filter ID (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

For instance, the code C1L2 means:

    - Circular polarization of the L band
    - Filter n.1 of the L band 
    - Linear polarization of the P band
    - Filter n.2 of the P band

The * character means the corresponding value should not change. For instance, the
code *1** means:

    - Do not change the polarization of the L band
    - Filter n.1 of the L band
    - Do not change the polarization of the P band
    - Do not change the filter of the P band
