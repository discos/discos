	/**
	* This module defines the interface of the 7 GHZ receiver installed in the SRT.
	* This is single feed receiver, in which we can monitor just one stage of amplification.

    * <br>
	* @copybrief Receivers::Receiver::status
	* the single bits of the status word assumed the following meaning:
	* @arg \c 0 REMOTE, set if the receiver is in remote and can be controlled remotely, error
	* @arg \c 1 VACUUMSENSOR, set if the vacuum sensos is turned on, status
	* @arg \c 2 VACUUMPUMPSTATUS, set if the vacuum pump is on, status
	* @arg \c 3 VACUUMPUMPFAULT, set if the vacuum pump is in fault state, error
	* @arg \c 4 VACUUMVALVEOPEN, set if the vacuum valve i sopen, status
	* @arg \c 5 COOLHEADON, set if the cool head is turned on, status
	* @arg \c 6 NOISEMARK, set is the calibration diode is on, status
	* @arg \c 7 EXTNOISEMARK, set if the control of the calibration diode from external source is enabled, status
	* @arg \c 8 CONNECTIONERROR, set if an error was found during the comunication from/to the receiver, error
	* @arg \c 9 UNLOCKED, set if at least one of the local oscillator is not locked, error
	* @copybrief Receivers::CommonReceiverInterface::setLO 
	* In this implementation just one Local osccilator value is supported and so only the first provided value will be considered
