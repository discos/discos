1) I wonder why if I close the control Socket also the Status socket is automatically closed.
2) why the command general structure requires a "Command Counter" and also the mode command or parameter command requires a command counter. The counter returned by 
   the status message frame seems to be the one reported in the mode command or parameter command part of the message.
3) the remote mode command "DriveTostow2 does not work for azimuth in the simulator!
4) in the pointing status frame, the parameter command status structure should be offset by 115 bytes, instead the displacement is 121 bytes. What about the 6 bytes 
   between 115 and 121? This justifies the difference between the documented size of status message frame and the effectively received bytes. 
5) In parameter command set offsets, the range is declared to be 86400000 seconds that corresponds to 1000 days: quite exotic. Apparently the last significant decimal
   digits is the third one. Sent 0.034356 the simulator displays 0.03400.    
   
6)  the "sectorSwitchAz" in Pointing Status reports 1 = upper sector active while the current azimuth is 1.5

7) The position flag in motors status seems to report "position not reached, corresponding to UINT8 value 0. 

8) In warning main axis the bit "StowPins_Extracted" has inverted logic: 0 means the pins are out.



a) Il comando setDeltaTime imposta correttamente (sul simulatore) il valore per P.T. time offset, ma il component per l'attributo DUt1 ritorna sempre zero. Bug mio?
b) voglio aggiungere il flag AXISACTIVE nello stato dell'asse.
c) Implementare program track
d) prendere valor idi configurazione dal CDB.
